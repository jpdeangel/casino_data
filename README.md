# Azure Oasis Casino Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project employs Python to meticulously examine casino data from the fictional Azure Oasis Casino, a simulated establishment created for this analysis. Emphasizing business performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, the project aims to glean valuable insights from this fabricated data set. Despite the data being fictional, our analysis rigorously delves into each facet, uncovering trends and patterns that exemplify strategic decision-making in a hypothetical casino environment.
